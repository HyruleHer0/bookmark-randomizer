A chrome extension that allows for the creation of named "sets" of bookmark folders.
A set can be clicked to open one of the bookmarks from within one of the folders randomly.
Sets can be modified after creation, or deleted.

When adding folders to a set, only the bookmarks directly within the folder will be selected from.
To select from subfolders, each subfolder must be added to the set individually.
Alternatively, the "Random-All" feature from the sets list will open a random bookmark from within all of the user's saved bookmarks.
